This is the "Friends" page—a small corner dedicated to those who live, write, and code with sincerity in the hidden nooks of the internet.

If you also maintain a website with heart, you are more than welcome to leave your link here. Let's shine a light for each other amidst the flowing tides of time.

## joining Instructions:

* **Independent Sites Only:** I accept personal blogs, homepages, or project showcases, provided they are accessible long-term.
* **Healthy & Legal Content:** Your site must be lawful and free from vulgarity or malicious information.
* **Substance Matters:** Please ensure your site has actual content, rather than just placeholders or advertisements.
* **Stay Active:** The site should be updated occasionally—at the very least, not "last updated in a previous era."
* **Reciprocity:** Please add this site to your links first. It's a small gesture of mutual connection.

## When applying, please provide:

Your **Name**, **URL**, a short **Bio**, and an **Avatar** or icon.

Leave your details in the comment section below, and I'll add you as soon as I see them!
