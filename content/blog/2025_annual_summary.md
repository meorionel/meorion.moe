## The goals set for 2024 📝

### **Top-up Bachelor's Degree Exam**

In 2024 summer holiday, my original plan was to find an internship job, but I couldn't find any job in Nanning.

Later, I found out that my school was offering free training courses for the Top-up Bachelor's Degree entrance exam.

At that point, I decided to give it a try. My plan was simple: spend one year preparing for the exam and then see what would happen. Even if I failed, I would still have more than three months to look for an internship afterward.

My family had been encouraging me to take this exam since my second year in the associate degree program, but I had always resisted the idea. I knew I was weak in math and English, and I didn't feel confident at all.

Surprisingly, the 2025 exam turned out to be much easier than I had expected. In the end, I was admitted to a bachelor's degree program. Although it is not a top-tier university, it is still a bachelor's degree — and for me, that matters.

## What projects have you made 📦

### **PinkLine**

https://github.com/meorionel/PinkLine

PinkLine is a blog template I built at the beginning of this year. Since I started blogging in 2023, I've gone through several blog themes, all of which were developed by myself. My tech stack evolved from Hexo to VitePress, then to Vue with MySQL after I learned Vue.

Whenever I learn a new skill, I tend to apply it directly to my blog. As my skills improve, I often feel that my earlier code has become messy or overcomplicated, so I refactor it repeatedly. (GPT even awarded me "The Infinite Refactor Award")

This version of the blog was developed after I became familiar with Next.js and Nuxt. To be honest, Nuxt is excellent for content-driven websites. It provides out-of-the-box SSR, auto imports, file-based routing, and has a strong community ecosystem. After getting used to it, I now find it difficult to go back to plain Vue.

My previous blog was built with Vue and MySQL, which made content management unnecessarily abstract and complex. In contrast, PinkLine uses Nuxt's official CMS (nuxt/content), which significantly simplifies the entire workflow.

All articles are written as plain .md files, even pages. Nuxt also provides an official content editor — you only need to install the dependencies to start using it.

### **Orange**

https://github.com/meorionel/orange

During the summer holiday, I started a Minecraft server with my friends. As usual, we needed a gameplay document to help new players get started more easily.

Other servers typically use online tools such as Tencent Docs. At first, others planned to do the same, but since this was closely related to my professional field, I insisted on building an official website from scratch.

The site is also built with nuxt/content. In addition, I implemented several backend interfaces using Nuxt's built-in server to query and display server plugin data.

### **nuxt-oneko**

https://github.com/meorionel/nuxt-oneko

nuxt-oneko is a Nuxt plugin that displays a kitten on the page, inspired by the classic Macintosh desktop toy. The kitten follows the user's pointer and moves around dynamically.

The original version was a standalone JavaScript plugin. I refactored it into a Nuxt plugin, allowing developers to use it simply by installing the package and adding it to nuxt.config.ts.

### **Minecraft3DHead**

https://github.com/meorionel/Minecraft3DHead

This interface is written in js and can obtain the player's Minecraft skin, then crop and stitch it together to form a 3D head. It is an interface used in Orange documentation.

## shopping 💸

### **MacBook**

I bought a second-hand 2017 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM from the used market at the beginning of the year.

Owning a MacBook had been a long-cherished wish of mine, and I genuinely love Apple's design philosophy From the UI design of the operating system to the industrial design of the hardware, everything feels exactly right to me

In 2025, 8GB of RAM is no longer enough for heavy workloads Still, whenever I need to write code, I almost always choose this MacBook over my Windows desktop.

### **Lumix Camera**

Buying a camera was another long-standing wish of mine

in high school, I wanted one badly, but due to limited finances, I could only afford a CCD Camera.

Even so, that CCD captured many memories of my youth and recorded a large part of my high school life.

After I was admitted to a bachelor's degree program, my uncle rewarded me with 5,000 RMB.

Originally, the money was meant for a laptop, but since I had already bought a MacBook Pro, so I used it to buy a camera.

a brand-new Panasonic G85 with a 25mm F1.7 lens.

I originally intended to encourage myself to go out and take more photos during the holiday, but in reality, I only took it out two or three times. The rest of the time, it was gathering dust.

### **Xiaomi Pad**

This year, I bought two headphones, both from Shuiyueyu. A loyal fan of Shuiyueyu said so.

The first tablet I bought was a Xiaomi Pad with an 8GB + 128GB configuration.

There's a saying that buying a tablet is all about "productivity before purchase, iQIYI after purchase".
Fortunately, I bought a tablet precisely for the "iQIYI" part, so there was no disappointment at all.

I mainly use it to watch videos and play *Reverse:1999*.

Aside from being slightly inconvenient to carry around, the overall experience is much more comfortable than using a phone, and there's no issue with dust buildup either.

### **Audio**

This year, I bought two pairs of earphones, both from Moondrop — that's what a loyal Moondrop fan would say, after all.

One is the **JIU**, and the other is **Space Travel**.

For daily use, whether in the dormitory or at home, I prefer the wired CHU.

They are small and lightweight, and even after wearing them for a long time, they don't create any uncomfortable pressure on my ears.

**Space Travel** is mainly for going out.

Bluetooth is undeniably convenient, but because the earbuds are relatively large, wearing them for extended periods can make my ears feel squeezed and slightly painful.

I also have a speaker from EDIFIER. Most of the time, it's connected to my computer, but when I'm taking a shower, I use it to play all kinds of loud, rustic DJ music.

## Goals for 2026 🚩

* Replace my current MacBook with a new one. I don't want to use a second-hand laptop anymore.
* Find a solid internship. As long as it's related to my major, I'll be satisfied.
* Travel to a new place and finally put my camera to good use.
* Improve my English, at least to the point where I can browse Twitter without any barriers.
